# Marketing-Analytics-Power-BI-
This repo contains a Marketing Analytics data analysis project conducted using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

Business Problem/Scenario:

E-commerce platforms rely heavily on online advertising to acquire new customers and retain existing ones. However, in an increasingly competitive market and with  fluctuating ad costs, businesses face two main challenges in their advertising efforts:
A) Inefficient Ad Spend
B) Identifying Effective Advertising Channels
To tackle these challenges, Harley Analytics - a data analytics start-up, has been commissioned by one of its Nordic clients to perform Marketing Analytics on Ad campaigns undertaken since January 2023. 
Marketing analytics is the process of using data to understand how marketing campaigns perform with the aim of identifying how to improve them. This helps businesses identify which Ad strategies work best, where to spend resources, and how to better connect with customers.

Aims of the Analysis:
A) Identify the top performing advertising channels for Harley Analytics' Nordic client
B) Evaluate the effectiveness of the client's Ad campaigns in their different Nordic markets
C) Facilitate data-driven decision making regarding the business' marketing efforts.

Data Description:
The client has made an Excel spreadsheet with their Ad Campaigns data available to Harley Analytics. The Spreadsheet contains the following columns:
1. Campaign ID - Unique numerical identifier for each Ad campaign.
2. Platform - Aadvertising Channel where the campaign was conducted. These include: Facebook, Twitter, Google Ads, Instagram, and Youtube.
3. AdDuration - The length of time, in weeks, that the Ad campaign ran.
4. Cost - Amount of money (in Euros) spent on the Ads
5. Impressions - Number of times the ad was shown.
6. Clicks - Number of times the ad was clicked.
7. Conversions - Number of actions taken as a result of the ad.
8. ConversionValue - The total revenue generated from the conversions of the ad.
9. CPC [Cost per click] - How much was spent for each ad click.
10. Country - The country where the Ad campaign was targeted.

Tech Stack:
The data for this project was analyzed using Power BI and Excel as the data source.

Project Scope:
1. Data ETL - The data was pre-processed in Microsoft Excel prior to connection to Power BI. Extra calculated columns were added to the Excel data to include the conversion rate and the return on ad spend [ROAS] of each ad campaign.
2. Data Modelling - Create and manage data relationships to facilitate time intelligence calculations. For this A date table was created in Power BI and then related to the fact data table.
3. Data Analysis and Visualization - Several DAX measures were created to define the KPIs
4. Reporting and recommendations: Insights and recommendations from the analysis were outlined

Inspiration:
The inspiration for this project is from amdari.io. The data for this project was synthesized using Microsoft Excel and follows the format of the similar project on Amdari.
